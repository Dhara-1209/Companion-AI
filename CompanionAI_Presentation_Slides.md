---

## SLIDE 4: HOW IT WORKS
**The RAG Process:**

**Step 1: RETRIEVAL** 🔍
User asks → AI converts to vector → Searches 652 manual chunks

**Step 2: AUGMENTATION** 📖  
Combines user question + relevant manual sections

**Step 3: GENERATION** 🤖
AI creates step-by-step troubleshooting guide

**Safety Override:** 🚨 Emergency detection bypasses everything

**Example Flow:**
"Samsung E3 error" → Drainage manual chunks → "Check drain hose, clean filter..."

## SLIDE 5: SAFETY-FIRST DESIGN
**4-Level Safety System:**

🟢 **SAFE** - Normal troubleshooting
🟡 **CAUTION** - Minor warnings  
🟠 **DANGER** - Strong safety alerts
🔴 **EMERGENCY** - Immediate evacuation

**Emergency Detection:**
• Gas leaks: "smell gas", "gas leak"
• Electrical: "sparking", "shock", "smoke"  
• Water damage: "flooding", "major leak"

**Emergency Response Example:**
Input: "I smell gas from my oven"
Output: 🚨 GAS EMERGENCY - EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY 🚨
